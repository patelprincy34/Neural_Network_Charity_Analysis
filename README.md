# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Overview
The goal of this project is to examine and classify the success of charitable donations using deep-learning neural networks and the TensorFlow framework in Python.
For the analysis, we preprocess the data for the neural network model, then compile, train, evaluate the model and optimize the model.
