# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Overview
The goal of this project is to examine and classify the success of charitable donations using deep-learning neural networks and the TensorFlow framework in Python.
For the analysis, we preprocess the data for the neural network model, then compile, train, evaluate the model and optimize the model.  

## Results

## Summary
This model was unable to achieve the aim of 75% accuracy and did not appear to respond to modifications. With the complexities of the descion trees, Random Forest may be intricate enough to make a difference and modify the accuracy and loss.
